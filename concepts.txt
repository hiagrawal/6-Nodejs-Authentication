For encrypting password:
npm install --save bcryptjs

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

for CSRF token: this is a package for node express which allows us to generate csrf token 
npm install --save csurf

1. we will include this pkg in application
const csrf = require('csurf');
2. Then we will initialize it like we are doing for express and mongoDb store
const csrfProtection = csrf();
3. Then we will add this as a middleware. This should be after sessions middleware has been added as it uses session.
app.use(csrfProtection);
4. so now every request that comes through will pass through this csrf middleware. 
It validates all 'post' requests since post request has the data 
5. Now we need to add csrf token to request that come to the server so server will check for this csrf token 
and hence validates that it is a coming from a genuine request and not any fraud request

for this, view (ui) must pass this csrf token, that is view (ui) must have access to this token
so, when we render the page, we pass this paramter to view (ui) and then view (ui) passes this to server in post request 
and server validates the same

for this, we have csrfToken() method added by middleware that generates a random hashed csrf token
which we pass to the view and send back the same in post request
this should be with the name '_csrf' only as it looks for value of this tag only to validate the same

Now, we need all views to add access to this token. For this we will have to pass this csrf paramter to our view 
whereever we render the view

to avoid this, we can add a middleware and set all variables that we need access to in all our views in res locals
res.locals is a feature provided by node expressjs to set all local variables that we need to access in all views

so, before we add our route middleware, we will add this middlware to add locals

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Flash:

If we want some data to show in any middleware on basis of other middleware that is we want data to get access between multiple
requests, then we can use sessions. But storing data in sessions for some error messages and then removing it might be very
cumbersome and for this we have connect-flash package which uses sessions internally and remove it from session later automatically
npm install --save connect-flash

1. First we need to include this in our application
2. then we need to initialize it. This needs to be initialized after session
3. this gives us access to flash() method through which we can set anything
4. and access the same in another request middleware through key

Sending Emails:

Sending Email is highly complex and require a 'Mail Server' to handle all requests
Hence majorly all companies including udemy using third party 'Mail Server' like aws encrypting
and we also will use third party pkg to send mails
There are many mail servers available like: 
SES, AWS, MailTrim, SendGrid

we will be using SendGrid as it is free till we send 100 mails in a day: https://sendgrid.com/

Signup in SendGrid by creating an account
Post signing up, verify single sender verification process
make sure everywhere email addresses mentioned are the valid ones

Now need to install this pkg in nodejs application
npm install --save nodemailer nodemailer-sendgrid-transport

nodemailer is used to for accessing email functionality in nodejs and 
nodemailer-sendgrid-transport is used to interact with nodejs with SendGrid

After signing up in SendGrid, go to Settings on the left panel -> API Keys -> and create an API key
This will create an API key, copy that key and use it in api_key field in auth object inside sendGridTransport

const nodemailer = require('nodemailer');
const sendgridTransport = require('nodemailer-sendgrid-transport');

const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport(sendgridTransport({
  auth: {
    api_key: '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'
  }
}))

transporter.sendMail({
          to: email,
          from: 'agrawal.hina13@gmail.com',
          subject: 'Signup Succeeded!',
          html: '<h1>You successfully signed up!</h1>'
        })   
      })

Advance Authentication:

Here we want to achieve Reset Password functionality
For Reset Password, we will give user a screen wherein user can enter email address, and when user click on REset Password
willl send an link to the email provided and that link should be valid for some time only so will set an expiry date/time

For this, we will create a unique token with some expiry date and store it in database so when user clicks on the link in the email,
we would verify that that link is being sent by us only

'crypto' is an inbuilt library provided by nodejs that helps to create a secure unique random value

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Authorization:

Authorization means getting access to only those data which it has authorized to.

Currently in our admin page, any user can edit or delete the product
But we want only that user to edit or delete it, who has created it

and for this, in admin products, we only show those products which are created by that user

and to implement this, when we fetch the products on admin page from db, we pass the filter to fetch only those products
for which userId is the logged in user id. and Logged in user we are saving in req.user in app js field

so this way, we can achieve Authorization

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Validations

Server sode validations are the most important and crucial as validations can be done at client side
but that is only for good user experience and does not solve the main purpose as end user can edit it from console or disable
javascript. Hence server side validations are key

With Express for validations, we have express validator pkg

https://github.com/express-validator/express-validator/tree/56518106696e0c4a87a458c097ebca02be534f5c

https://express-validator.github.io/docs/

https://github.com/validatorjs/validator.js :  To see all built-in validators

npm install --save express-validator

Now lets add basic form validations for signUp page
that email should be of email type
Password should be 5 characters long
and password and confirm password should match

Error Handling:

Synchronous code are handled using try catch block and asynchronous code can be handled using then and catch

we have 'throw new Error' provided by nodejs that we can use to throw the error but it throws exception 
and stops the further execution

to avoid, we can catch the thrown error and handle it so code execution will continue as is

we can check this in error-playground.ejs file

In routes file, where we are using express-validator middleware, there for custom validation we are throwing error using 
'throw new Error' which throws the error so it is being internally catched by express-validator and so it gives us all the errors 
array including thrown error in validationResult

In case of catch() method, wherein we are just logging the error which anyways is crashing the page and execution,
we can make a generic error 500 page which is a server error code and render that page instead of exception

Expressjs Error handling middleware
when we give next(new Error()) then expressjs skips all other middleware and goes to the error handling middleware
This is a special middleware which takes 4 argumnets: error, req, res, next which indicates that this is a error handling middlware

If we have more than one error handling middleware, then they will execute from top to bottom just like the normal middleware

----------------------------------------------

Error Handling in sync and async calls execution:

To reach to the expressjs error middleware, we call the next method with the new error to go to the error handling middleware. 
This is in case we have async calls like in then and catch, promises, callbacks. 
There we necessarily need to call 'next(new Error())' to reach to the middleware

However, if it is Synchronous call, then can directly call 'throw new Error('Some dummy error')' to reach to the expressjs 
error handling middleware

File Upload and download

 - We will learn how to upload and download files from the server
 - in Add product, instead of ImageUrl, we now will use file upload

 When we use File, we see that image field is always blank in postAddProduct req body
 This is because, to read every request, we use 'bodyParser.urlencoded' to fetch req data
 this works only for text field and can read and parse and understand only the text data
 But when we upload image, it is in bytes form and hence to parse it so that we can get it in req object, 
 we need third party package called 'multer'

 Multer parses incoming requests for Files. It can be used to parse text data as well. It parses both. 

It works on the basis of encType value provided in form.
By default, if we dont give any, form takes 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' encType value 
which means this file has only text type of data and hence bodyParser can parse it

Multer looks for encType value 'multipart/form-data' which indicates it has multiple type of data
and hence multer can parse text and file both type of data

Install:
npm install --save multer
