For encrypting password:
npm install --save bcryptjs

for CSRF token: this is a package for node express which allows us to generate csrf token 
npm install --save csurf

1. we will include this pkg in application
const csrf = require('csurf');
2. Then we will initialize it like we are doing for express and mongoDb store
const csrfProtection = csrf();
3. Then we will add this as a middleware. This should be after sessions middleware has been added as it uses session.
app.use(csrfProtection);
4. so now every request that comes through will pass through this csrf middleware. 
It validates all 'post' requests since post request has the data 
5. Now we need to add csrf token to request that come to the server so server will check for this csrf token 
and hence validates that it is a coming from a genuine request and not any fraud request

for this, view must pass this csrf token, that is view must have access to this token
so, when we render the page, we pass this paramter to view and then view passes this to server in post request 
and server validates the same

for this, we have csrfToken() method added by middleware that generates a random hashed csrf token
which we pass to the view and send back the same in post request
this should be with the name '_csrf' only as it looks for value of this tag only to validate the same
